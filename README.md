## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes MobileNet-v2 model for accurate object detection
- **Modern UI/UX**: Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens in the browser - your images never leave your device
- **80+ Object Classes**: Trained on the comprehensive COCO dataset
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Export Results**: Download detection results with bounding boxes and labels
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive file upload with drag and drop support

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glass morphism design
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js, COCO-SSD model
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed on your machine
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubham5027/CamvisionAI-computer-vision-based-object-Detection.git
cd CamvisionAI-computer-vision-based-object-Detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Model Loading**: The app automatically loads the pre-trained COCO-SSD model when you first visit
2. **Image Upload**: Users can drag & drop or click to upload images (supports JPG, PNG, GIF up to 10MB)
3. **Object Detection**: TensorFlow.js processes the image and identifies objects with confidence scores
4. **Visualization**: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels
5. **Export**: Users can download the annotated results

## üé® Design Features

- **Glass Morphism**: Modern frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Animations**: Smooth color transitions and hover effects
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatic theme detection
- **Loading States**: Elegant loading animations and progress indicators

## üìä Supported Objects

The model can detect 80+ object classes including:
- People, animals, vehicles
- Household items, furniture
- Food items, kitchen utensils
- Sports equipment, electronics
- And many more from the COCO dataset
