#Object Detection Full Stack Project

Introduction

Welcome to our Object Detection project, where we leverage the power of Next.js and TensorFlow's Machine Learning capabilities to identify objects within images. This project utilizes MobileNet-V2, a lightweight deep learning model, trained on the extensive COCO dataset, ensuring accurate and efficient object detection.

Features
Real-time object detection in images
Integration with TensorFlow.js and MobileNet-V2 model
Front-end built using Next.js for rapid development and seamless user experience
Deployment on Vercel for high availability and performance
Demo videos showcasing the project in action
How to Use
Visit our deployment on Vercel at your Vercel deployment link to start detecting objects in your images. For a more in-depth look, check out our demo videos.

Installation
To run this project locally:

Clone the repository
